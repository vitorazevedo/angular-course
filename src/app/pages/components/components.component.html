  <h1>Comprehensive Guide to Angular Components</h1>
  <section>
    <h2>Introduction</h2>
    <p>In the world of Angular, components are the fundamental building blocks of the application's UI. They control the
      views (HTML/CSS) and handle user interactions, making them essential for any Angular project. This article offers
      an in-depth look at Angular components, covering their creation, lifecycle, and usage in building dynamic web
      applications.</p>

    <h2>What are Angular Components?</h2>
    <p>Angular components are TypeScript classes that interact with the HTML of your application to render the
      application's user interface. Each component consists of three primary files:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>TypeScript File (<code>.ts</code>)</strong>: Holds the logic of the component.</li>
      <li><strong>HTML Template File (<code>.html</code>)</strong>: Defines the view or the UI.</li>
      <li><strong>CSS/SCSS File (<code>.css</code>/<code>.scss</code>)</strong>: Contains the styling for the view.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Creating a Component</h2>
    <p>To create a new component in Angular, you typically use the Angular CLI command:</p>
    <app-code-preview [language]="data.preview.bash.language" [code]="data.preview.bash.code"></app-code-preview>
    <p>This command creates a directory with the component's TypeScript, HTML, and CSS files, along with a test file.
    </p>

    <h2>Anatomy of a Component</h2>
    <p>Let's break down what each part of a component does:</p>
    <h3>1. Component Class</h3>
    <p>The TypeScript class is decorated with <code>{{'@Component'}}</code>, which includes metadata about the
      component:</p>
    <app-code-preview [language]="data.preview.typescript.language"
      [code]="data.preview.typescript.code"></app-code-preview>
    <h3>2. HTML Template</h3>
    <p>The HTML template is where you define the component's structure and presentation:</p>
    <app-code-preview [language]="data.preview.html.language" [code]="data.preview.html.code"></app-code-preview>
    <h3>3. CSS/SCSS Styles</h3>
    <p>The styling file defines the look and feel of the component:</p>
    <app-code-preview [language]="data.preview.scss.language" [code]="data.preview.scss.code"></app-code-preview>

    <h2>Using ExampleComponent in the Application</h2>
    <p>To use <code>ExampleComponent</code>, you need to include it in one of your application's templates. Typically,
      this would be the main application component (<code>AppComponent</code>).</p>
    <app-code-preview [language]="data.preview.usage.language" [code]="data.preview.usage.code"></app-code-preview>

    <h2>Component Lifecycle</h2>
    <p>Angular manages the lifecycle of components, providing lifecycle hooks to tap into key events:</p>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>ngOnInit</strong>: Initializes the component.</li>
      <li><strong>ngOnChanges</strong>: Executes when the input properties change.</li>
      <li><strong>ngOnDestroy</strong>: Cleans up before the component is destroyed.</li>
    </ol>
  </section>
  <section>
    <h2>Communication and Data Binding</h2>
    <p>Components communicate with each other and display data using:</p>
    <ul>
      <li><strong>Input and Output Decorators</strong>: To share data between parent and child components.</li>
      <li><strong>Event Emitters</strong>: To emit events from child to parent components.</li>
      <li><strong>Services</strong>: For shared functionality across multiple components.</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Best Practices</h2>
    <ol>
      <li><strong>Single Responsibility</strong>: Each component should focus on a specific task.</li>
      <li><strong>Encapsulation</strong>: Use encapsulation to control component styling.</li>
      <li><strong>Use Services</strong>: For shared logic across components.</li>
      <li><strong>Testing</strong>: Write unit tests for your components.</li>
    </ol>

    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
    <p>Angular components are the essence of Angular applications. Understanding how to create, use, and manage
      components is vital for any Angular developer. By following best practices and effectively utilizing lifecycle
      hooks, you can build efficient, maintainable, and scalable Angular applications.</p>
